# Image Classification and Influence Functions with PyTorch

## About
This is our project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artifical Intelligence) which focuses on classifying images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

## Issues Faced and Reference Fixes
1. Error: TypeError: can't convert cuda:0 device type tensor to numpy. Use Tensor.cpu() to copy the tensor to host memory first.
  - Solution: https://github.com/nimarb/pytorch_influence_functions/issues/34

2. Error: Index error within Influence Function 
  - Solution: Update calc_influence_function
    - default value for test_start_index is 'None' instead of False
    - fixes bug when test_start_index is set to 0
